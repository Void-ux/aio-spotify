Contributing
============

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. It makes the library substantially better.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository to make it easier for regulars here. These are guidelines, not hard rules!

Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------
Submitting a pull request is fairly simple, just make sure it focuses on a single aspect and doesn't manage to have scope creep and it's probably good to go. 
It would be lovely to keep the style consistent, aio-spotify tends to follow the PEP-8 guidelines with a column limit of 125.

Git Commit Guidelines
---------------------
- Use present tense (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Limit all lines to 72 characters or less.
